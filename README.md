# jobo-70mm

This is a 3D-printable adapter to develop 70mm film in Jobo 2502 spirals.

## Purpose

70mm film is a little wider than 120 film, so it doesn't fit in a normal film spiral.  This adapter 
is a sleeve that is to be inserted into the middle of a Jobo 2502 spiral (as used in the 2xxx tanks),
thereby making the spiral wider and allowing 70mm film to be inserted into a 2502 spiral and developed
in a 2xxx tank.

## Limitations

It is not compatible with Jobo 1xxx spirals/tanks, or with Paterson spirals.

While you can buy dedicated 70mm developing spirals and tanks, but they are very expensive.  Many of us
have basic Jobo gear, and this allows small quantities of 70mm film to be developed.

The adapter should be printed in ABS with 100% infill, and (for FDM) in the orientation shown, i.e. a vertical cylinder.
Assuming you want to develop multiple spirals of film in a single batch, you will need to print multiple adapters.

## Usage

A 2502 spiral can hold about 1.6m of film - enough for a 135-36 roll, two 120 rolls or a 220 roll.
Therefore, you cannot expose 20 feet of 70mm and expect to stuff it all into a single spiral and develop
it in a single batch.  You need to find some way of marking the film off into 220-lengths and cutting the film
at the right points when unloading it from your canister into the spiral

I do this by putting little tabs of sticky tape onto the film, through the gate on the back.  First, expose 
a suitable quantity, e.g. 20 frames of 6x7.  Advance one frame, pull the darkslide by a couple centimetres and
stick some tape to the film, then advance again.  Expose another 20 frames, and repeat.

When applying the tape, use about 4cm, and fold the adhesive faces together so that it sticks together with
about 5mm of fresh adhesive exposed.  This gives a non-adhesive flap that can poke out from the film and be
felt easily in the dark without getting fingerprints all over the film.

When unloading the film, you can feel for the tape loop and cut it at that point, in the middle of the wasted frame.

The adapter makes the spirals wider, therefore fewer fit into a single tank.  One spiral will still fit into the
single-spiral tank, but only two expanded spirals will fit into the three-spiral tank.  The same fluid-minimum
levels apply.
